<h1>Munro bagging app</h1>

<p>A Munro is a mountain in Scotland with a height over 3,000 feet (914 m). This project aims to create an app allowing hikers to keep track of all munros they climbed and compare themselves to others.</p>


<h2>### MVP:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Display a list of hikers</li>
  <li>Show individual hikers and see a list of all munros they've climbed</li>
  <li>Display a list of munros</li>
  <li>Show individual munros and see how many hikers have climbed it</li>
  <li>View all hikes (ordered by the latest)</li>
  <li>Create new hikes</li>
  <li>Create new hikers</li>
</ul>

### Possible Extensions:

- Display the highest munro climbed for each hiker
- Add a difficulty level to each munro; display the most difficult munro for each hiker
- View hikes by region
- Allow hikers to have personal goals (e.g. climb 10 munros)
